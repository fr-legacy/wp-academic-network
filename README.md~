Teachblog
=========

Adds capabilities to let students create their own blogs and interact with other students from within a teacher
moderated framework. Designed to operate within a single existing site (or site within a network) with low overheads and
essential protections baked in. Teachblog is a free and open source plugin for WordPress.

It's current status is *in early development* and it is not yet ready for "real world" use.

1. Licensing
============

As a plugin for WordPress, Teachblog inherits the GNU General Public License (and exercises its right to use version 3
of that license). A full copy of the license should be included with the plugin.

2. Rationale
============

Why corral content into posts and taxonomies resembling blogs, as Teachblog does, instead of creating new sites for each
student, either standalone or within an existing multisite network? It means a single teacher running a single site on a
network can direct their students' blog activity from a familiar environment and with minimal administrative hassle.

3. Basic Concepts
=================

There are three cornerstones to Teachblog.

* It's users - both _students_ and _teachers_ - who can interact with one another with varying degrees of freedom. A
teacher is expected quite simply to be an administrator or editor of the site.
* _Student content_ is any post (including images, other media or comments) submitted by a student.
* Most content belonging to a single student will be grouped into a _student blog,_ one for each student user.
